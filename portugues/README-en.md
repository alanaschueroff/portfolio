Hello, my name is Alana Schueroff, brazilian, 23 y/o, living currently in Brazil.
I have been to 24 countries, lived in 3 and 3 continents.
My love for web development grew when I saw Karlie Kloss leaving Victoria's Secret and started programming.

I started in 2016 with a scholarship and from that I landed my first job as Front-End Web Developer in December 2016.
Now I'm looking for a new job and type of work, I'm learning more about canvas, animations and learning more about JavaScript.

You can see my temporary portfolio in this git and let me know if you want to talk or just make a suggestion, I love suggestions.

Have a great coffee and a lovely day.
